## <a name="author"></a> ‚ú® 2. About the author

My ([@lanedirt](https://github.com/lanedirt)) journey into software development began in 2007 at the age of 14 when I discovered the source code for Ugamela, an early open-source PHP clone of OGame. I really liked running my own browser game server and dedicated myself to modifying this version and translating it to Dutch, leading to the launch of OGameX.nl. This server, active from 2007 to 2009, nurtured a small yet engaged community. This experience not only sparked my passion for software development but also laid the groundwork for my professional career. OGame has always held a special place in my heart, which is why now, 15 years later, I've decided to return to it and create this open-source clone from the ground up.

## <a name="goal"></a> ‚ú® 3. Goal

The primary goal of this fan-based project is to engineer a faithful rendition of OGame, specifically reflecting its state prior to the Lifeforms update introduced in 2020. This initiative, purely fan-based and non-commercial, is pursued strictly for educational purposes.

## <a name="roadmap"></a> üñ•Ô∏è 4. Roadmap

OGameX is under active development with a lot of core features already implemented and working:

- Planets / buildings / research / shipyard / defense / galaxy / highscores / messages
- Fleet dispatch missions (transport, deployment, colonisation, espionage, attack, recycle)
- Battle engine
  - Rust version for high performance via PHP FFI (up to 200x faster compared to PHP)
  - PHP version as fall-back
- Moon
  - Moon creation through debris field after battle
  - Moon buildings
- Admin panel

### <a name="upcoming-features"></a> Upcoming Features

The next major upcoming features that are being worked on:

- Expedition mission (and all associated features such as game units and logic)
- Moon
  - Phalanx feature
  - Jump Gate feature
  - Moon destruction fleet dispatch mission
- Improved fleet mission processing via worker queue
- Missile attacks
- Alliances
- ACS fleet dispatch missions
- Merchant & shop (non-commercial)
- Multi-language (making all in-game strings translatable)

## <a name="disclaimer"></a> üìì 6. Disclaimer

This project is a non-commercial hobby project. All rights and concepts related to OGame are owned by GameForge GmbH. We encourage supporters to try the official OGame at https://ogame.org to support its creators.

## <a name="installation"></a> üñ•Ô∏è 7. Installation
The recommended way to install OGameX is by running the bundled Docker containers. This takes care of all the dependencies and is the easiest way to get started.

If you instead wish to install OGameX manually, see the list of requirements for Laravel 12.x and how to deploy manually to a server here: https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/deployment.

### <a name="development"></a> a) Install for local development
For local development use the default docker-compose file that is included in this repository. This configuration is optimized for development and includes several tools that are useful for debugging and testing.

Please note that performance of the development mode is slow on Windows (compared to MacOS/Linux) due to overhead of running Docker on Windows. Loading pages with development mode enabled can take multiple seconds on Windows. If you want to run OGameX on Windows, I advise to use the production mode instead. One of the main differences is that the production configuration enables PHP OPcache which speeds up the application, but this also means that the PHP files are not updated (instantly) when you change them. This makes it less suitable for development.

1. Clone the repository.
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/lanedirt/OGameX.git
  $ cd OGameX
  ```

2. Launch the project using Docker Compose:
  ```
  $ docker compose up -d
  ```
  > The default setup binds to ports 80/443. Modify `docker-compose.yml` if needed. PhpMyAdmin is also included for database management and is bound to port 8080. If you don't create a .env, the default .env.example will be copied to create it.

**Important:** it can take up to 10 minutes for the `ogamex-app` container to start, this is because of composer initialization and Rust compiling that happens on the first run. Please be patient and wait for all containers to have fully started.

After the docker containers have started, visit http://localhost to access OGameX.

Create a new account to start using OGameX. The first account created will be automatically assigned the admin role.

> Note: if you need to run manual `php artisan` commands, you can SSH into the `ogamex-app` container with the `docker compose exec -it ogamex-app bash` command.

### <a name="production"></a> b) Install for production
For production there is a separate docker-compose file called `docker-compose.prod.yml`. This configuration contains
several performance optimizations and security settings that are not present in the development configuration.

***Caution:*** the production configuration is not yet fully optimized and should be used with caution. As an example, the database root user uses a default password which should be changed to something unique. You should review all settings before deploying this project to a publicly accessible server.

The instructions below are for Linux. OGameX should also work under Docker for Windows but the steps might be a little bit different.

1. Clone the git repo.
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/lanedirt/OGameX.git
  $ cd OGameX
  ```

2. Copy `.env.example-prod` to `.env`.
  ```
  $ cp .env.example-prod .env
  ```

3. Launch the project using Docker Compose:
  ```
  $ docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --force-recreate
  ```

  > The default setup binds to ports 80/443, to change it modify `docker-compose.yml`. PhpMyAdmin is also included for database management and is bound to port 8080, however to access it you need to explicitly specify your IP addresses via `./docker/phpmyadmin/.htaccess` for safety purposes.

**Important:** it can take up to 10 minutes for the `ogamex-app` container to start, this is because of composer initialization and Rust compiling that happens on the first run. Please be patient and wait for all containers to have fully started.

After the docker containers have started, visit https://localhost to access OGameX.

Create a new account to start using OGameX. The first account created will be automatically assigned the admin role.

> Note: The production version runs in forced-HTTPS (redirect) mode by default using a self-signed SSL certificate. If you want to access the application via HTTP, open `.env` and change `APP_ENV` from `production` to `local`.

## <a name="upgrade"></a> üñ•Ô∏è 8. Upgrade and misc instructions

### Upgrade OGameX to a new version
If you want to upgrade an existing installation of OGameX to a new version, follow these steps:

1. Stop the existing containers:
  ```
  $ docker compose down
  ```
  2. Pull the latest changes from the main branch or checkout the new release tag:
  ```
  $ git pull origin main
  ```
  -- or --
  ```
  $ git checkout 0.11.0 # replace with the latest release tag
  ```
  3. Rebuild and start the containers:

  **For development:**
  ```
  $ docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
  ```
  **For production:**
  ```
  $ docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build --force-recreate --remove-orphans
  ```
  > When the docker containers are started, the entrypoint script in `./docker/entrypoint.sh` will automatically run the appropriate laravel install commands to upgrade the database schema and refresh the cache. Note that depending on the migrations this might take a short while. After the containers are started, you can visit the application at `https://localhost` (or http://localhost) to check if the upgrade was successful. If you run into any issues, please check the logs for more information or open an issue on GitHub.

### Assigning admin role
By default, the first registered user is assigned the admin role which can see the admin bar and is able to change server settings. You can also assign the admin role manually via the command line:
  ```
  $ php artisan ogamex:assign-admin-role {username}
  ```
  To remove the admin role from a user, use the following command:
  ```
  $ php artisan ogamex:remove-admin-role {username}
  ```
