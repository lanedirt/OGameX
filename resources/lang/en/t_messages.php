Congratulations on starting your illustrious career. I will be here to guide you through your first steps.

On the left, you can see the menu, which allows you to supervise and govern your galactic empire.

You’ve already seen the Overview. Resources and Facilities allow you to construct buildings to help you expand your empire. Start by building a Solar Plant to harvest energy for your mines.

Then expand your Metal Mine and Crystal Mine to produce vital resources. Otherwise, simply take a look around for yourself. You’ll soon feel well at home, I’m sure.

You can find more help, tips and tactics here:

Discord Chat: Discord Server
Forum: OGameX Forum
Support: Game Support

You’ll only find current announcements and changes to the game in the forums.


Now you’re ready for the future. Good luck!
